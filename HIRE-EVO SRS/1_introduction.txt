1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI-Driven Hiring Platform, an intelligent recruitment application that leverages machine learning and portfolio analysis to assist both candidates and recruiters in the technical hiring process.

The purpose of this document is to:

Describe all features, behaviors, and constraints of the system in a structured and testable manner.

Serve as a contract between stakeholders, developers, and project owners regarding what will be built.

Provide a blueprint for implementation, testing, and future maintenance of the system.

This SRS will be used by:

Developers and data engineers building backend and AI components.

Frontend engineers implementing the web interface.

QA engineers validating compliance with functional and non-functional requirements.

Product owners, recruiters, and stakeholders reviewing and approving functionality before release.

1.2 Scope

The AI Hiring Platform is a web-based system that automates and enhances technical hiring through explainable AI.
Its main purpose is to analyze candidate data (CVs, GitHub, LinkedIn) and match candidates to job postings based on verified skills and real evidence.

System Objectives:

Accurate Matching: Rank candidates according to skills, experience, and verified portfolio signals.

Explainability: Provide transparent reasoning for each ranking decision.

Candidate Empowerment: Allow candidates to generate tailored CVs and cover letters optimized for specific roles.

Interview Readiness: Estimate the probability of passing a first interview and identify improvement areas.

Data Privacy: Protect user data through consent-based integrations and metadata-only access to private repositories.

Expected Outcomes:

Reduce recruiter time-to-shortlist by 50%.

Improve match quality with ≥0.75 Precision@5 in pilot tests.

Achieve candidate satisfaction ≥4.3/5 for generated CVs.

System Boundaries:

The system focuses on matching and assessment, not full applicant tracking or live code testing.

Deep code analysis is out of scope unless the user explicitly grants code-read permissions.

1.5 Overview

This document specifies:

Functional requirements of each core feature (job intake, candidate ingestion, matching, CV generation, prediction, etc.).

External interfaces (UI, API, and third-party integrations).

Logical and physical architecture of the system.

Data design, including entity relationships and privacy classifications.

AI/ML components, their evaluation metrics, and fairness safeguards.

Non-functional constraints such as performance, security, and reliability.

Subsequent sections detail how the system behaves, how its data flows, and how it will be tested and maintained.
