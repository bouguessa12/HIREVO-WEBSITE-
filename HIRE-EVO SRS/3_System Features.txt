System Features

This section defines each major functional component of the platform in detail — including its purpose, user stories, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria.

The goal is to clearly describe what the system must do, so that design, implementation, and testing can be directly derived from these requirements.

3.1 Feature 1: Applicant Data Aggregation

Description:
This module gathers applicant data from multiple external sources (GitHub, LinkedIn, CV uploads) to create a unified profile for AI evaluation.

Rationale:
Automates data collection to reduce recruiter effort and ensure consistency between candidate information sources.

User Stories:

As a recruiter, I want the system to automatically gather information from GitHub and LinkedIn so I can view a complete candidate profile in one place.

As an applicant, I want to upload my CV and provide links to my profiles, so the system can evaluate me accurately.

Functional Requirements:

System must accept candidate links for GitHub and LinkedIn.

System must authenticate or scrape data within API limits.

System must allow CV uploads in PDF or DOCX format.

Extracted data (skills, projects, education, work history) must be stored in structured form.

Duplicate or missing data must be detected and resolved.

Acceptance Criteria:

 CV successfully parsed and stored.

 GitHub and LinkedIn data fetched within 5 seconds average response time.

 Combined profile created without conflicting or missing fields.

3.2 Feature 2: Data Parsing and Normalization

Description:
Processes the collected data into a standardized internal structure for downstream AI evaluation.

Rationale:
Ensures uniform representation of skills, experiences, and other attributes regardless of data source.

User Stories:

As a developer, I want consistent candidate data formats so my AI models can process them efficiently.

As a recruiter, I want structured data fields like “Skills,” “Experience,” and “Projects” for easier report reading.

Functional Requirements:

Normalize job titles, dates, and skill names into predefined categories.

Convert free-text CV content into structured fields via NLP parsing.

Deduplicate overlapping information (e.g., same company from multiple sources).

Store normalized profiles in PostgreSQL.

Acceptance Criteria:

 All candidate profiles stored under a consistent schema.

 Parsing accuracy ≥ 90% for known skill/entity detection.

 No duplicate or inconsistent entries after processing.

3.3 Feature 3: AI Evaluation and Suitability Scoring

Description:
Evaluates each applicant’s relevance to a job posting using AI and NLP-based similarity analysis.

Rationale:
Provides recruiters with an automated, data-driven assessment of candidate suitability.

User Stories:

As a recruiter, I want a suitability score for each candidate so I can quickly identify top matches.

As a hiring manager, I want the AI’s decision-making to be transparent and justifiable.

Functional Requirements:

Represent job descriptions and candidate profiles as embeddings.

Calculate similarity using cosine or semantic distance.

Generate a suitability score (0–100).

Identify and list top matching skills and missing skills.

Provide a brief natural-language explanation of the score.

Acceptance Criteria:

 Score generated for each candidate within 10 seconds.

 Top 3 matching and missing skills correctly identified.

 Report includes an explanation of the ranking.

3.4 Feature 4: Report Generation and Ranking

Description:
Creates comprehensive candidate reports and ranked lists based on AI evaluation results.

Rationale:
Simplifies decision-making and provides visual clarity for HR teams.

User Stories:

As a recruiter, I want to see an ordered list of candidates with summarized profiles.

As a hiring manager, I want exportable reports I can share internally.

Functional Requirements:

Generate individual candidate reports (PDF/HTML).

Display ranked lists of candidates for each job posting.

Include filters for skill sets, education, experience, and location.

Allow exporting ranked results (CSV, PDF).

Highlight “best-fit” candidates visually.

Acceptance Criteria:

 Recruiter dashboard shows correct rankings per job.

 Reports generated within 5 seconds per candidate.

 Export function produces valid file formats.

3.5 Feature 5: Recruiter Dashboard

Description:
A web-based interface where recruiters can manage job postings, review candidate reports, and adjust ranking filters.

Rationale:
Centralizes all hiring activities within a single visual environment.

User Stories:

As a recruiter, I want a dashboard to post jobs, review applicants, and adjust evaluation criteria.

As an HR admin, I want analytics showing how many applicants were processed and shortlisted.

Functional Requirements:

Provide dashboard access via secure login (OAuth or email/password).

Display jobs, candidates, and rankings.

Allow job posting with skill/experience parameters.

Enable filtering and sorting of candidates.

Provide basic analytics (average score, candidate source breakdown).

Acceptance Criteria:

 Dashboard accessible only to authenticated users.

 All job postings and reports visible within recruiter’s workspace.

 Filters and analytics respond dynamically without page reload.

3.6 Feature 6: System Administration and Monitoring

Description:
Provides backend management tools for developers or admins to monitor system performance, integrations, and logs.

Rationale:
Ensures reliability, stability, and compliance of the system during operation.

User Stories:

As a system admin, I want to monitor API usage and performance to maintain uptime.

As a developer, I want access to logs and alerts for debugging issues.

Functional Requirements:

Track API request volume and latency.

Store logs of data collection and AI evaluations.

Monitor health of integration services (GitHub, LinkedIn, vector DB).

Display admin metrics in a protected console.

Support manual reprocessing of failed candidate analyses.

Acceptance Criteria:

 Admin dashboard displays system status in real time.

 Logging system records all major actions.

 Failed data fetches are automatically retried or logged for review.
