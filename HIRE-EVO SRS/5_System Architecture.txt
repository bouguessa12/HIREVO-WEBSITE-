System Architecture
5.1 Architectural Overview

The platform follows a modular service-based architecture built around a REST API core.
Main layers:

Frontend (UI): React/Next.js app for recruiters and admins.

Backend API: Python (FastAPI) for requests, authentication, and orchestration.

AI Service: separate microservice handling embeddings, scoring, and report generation.

Database Layer: PostgreSQL + Vector DB (Pinecone/FAISS).

Storage Layer: S3-compatible bucket for CVs and static files.

5.2 Logical Components

Auth Module: manages login, JWT tokens, roles.

Job Manager: CRUD for job postings.

Data Collector: interfaces GitHub / LinkedIn / CV Parser.

Data Processor: cleans + normalizes applicant data.

AI Evaluator: embedding, similarity, scoring.

Report Builder: formats results → HTML + PDF.

Dashboard API: aggregates analytics for frontend.

Admin Monitor: logs, system health, alerts.

5.3 Data Flow (simplified)
[Recruiter UI] → [Backend API] → [Data Collector]
        ↓                          ↓
   [PostgreSQL DB] ← [AI Evaluator] ← [Vector DB]
        ↓
   [Report Builder] → [Recruiter Dashboard]


Example flow:

Recruiter posts a job.

Candidate data collected → normalized → stored.

AI Evaluator generates embeddings → computes score.

Results saved → Report Builder formats output.

Recruiter dashboard displays ranked list.

5.4 Deployment Architecture

Frontend: hosted via Vercel / Netlify.

Backend & AI Service: containerized (Docker) → cloud (VM or Kubernetes).

Database: managed PostgreSQL + vector store.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy.

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana / Uptime Robot.

5.5 Security Layers

HTTPS TLS 1.3 for all traffic.

JWT auth with refresh tokens.

Role-based access (Recruiter/Admin).

Encrypted CV storage (AES-256).

Regular key rotation for external APIs.
